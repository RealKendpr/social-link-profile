## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

In this project I used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and I learned how to modify designs for different devices and how to utilize the tailwind theme feature. In addition I also learned how to re-use styles on different elements.

### Continued development

I want to know more about the tailwind theme and how to re-use styles on different elements for effectively. This is just a very small project for tailwind but I want to try tailwind on much bigger projects.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - They have a very well documented guide on how to use tailwind.
